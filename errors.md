we have error 413 - Request Entity Too Large for timers more than 15 minutes in prod: Failed to send to Telegram: Upload failed: 413 - Request Entity Too Large FUNCTION_PAYLOAD_TOO_LARGE iad1::qhv9r-1763695498706-6e33ac50ac36
Request Entity Too Large

FUNCTION_PAYLOAD_TOO_LARGE

iad1::wmlrd-1763695957456-38a45a4792d3
is it nextjs configuration/vercel configuration issue?



on iphone small timers less than 10 minutes dosnt use right fonts, they use default font, i think its times new roman or something like that
but for timer more than 10 minutes it use right Heading Now font
but error 413 - Request Entity Too Large still appears for timers more than 15 minutes

on iphone also for timers more than 20 minutes we are again have error with memory idk what actually error, but it reloads page, so i think its some memory leak
